A framework for creating LabVIEW HMIs for touch screen devices. Navigating through running vi's is done by swiping left or right across the screen with a touch and release motion or a click and release motion. Vi's are called from the suppervisory program and placed in sub panels. Each vi can be stopped/started/paused from the supervisory program.
